# Notes:
# - A person walking has a speed of â‰ˆ1.3 m/s.
#		But in a realistic scenario not everyone is walking and many people are stationary.
#		If we suppose 90% of people are stationary we have an average speed of 0.13m/s.
#		If we suppose 95% of people are stationary we have an average speed of 0.065m/s.
# - The spreading distance d depends on the virus itself and many other conditions.
#		For Covid an almost safe distance is thought to be 2m.
